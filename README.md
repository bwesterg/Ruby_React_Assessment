Ski Collection App - startup instructions:

***This backend was built using Ruby 2.6.6, but should run with anything above 2.4.0.  

Navigate to the ski_collection_backend directory (backend), and run 'bundle install'.  When dependencies are successfully added, run 'rails s' in the terminal.  This will start the backend server on http://localhost:3000.  If it's running correctly, the link should show the standard Rails message ('yay, you're on rails!').

In a separate terminal, navigate to the ski-collection directory, and run 'npm start'.  If you're asked if you want to run this on a localhost channel other than what the rails server runs (usually 3001 vs 3000), select 'yes' or 'y'.

Now, you will see the front page of the Ski Collection App.  After creating a profile+passowrd, you can start building a ski collection.  Once in a user's collection, skis can be modified or deleted.  Each user has their own set of skis.
